# How to run it?
You have to download SFML from this website https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php
If you are using Clion you have to install compiler matching sfml version then everything shoud be alright
CMake is setting SFML dir to C:\SFML but it will work at other directory if you cange it in CMakeList.txt
